          To reach KEK by bus from the city, one needs to board a bus
          bound for Kovalam Beach. There are Airconditioned buses
          plying from Terminal 10 opposite the East Fort Bus stand.

          From the main Kovalam Beach bus stop, go down to the beach,
          and walk towards light house beach. Use a small lane
          immediately after Malabar Cafe, to your left. Follow it,
          take a left at the next 'T', a right at the next 'T' and
          finally you will reach a larger street. Ask for "Abhi's
          Cafe". We are on the first floor.
