          Kovalam Ezhuthu Kalari is inspired from the old "Ezhuthu Kalari"
          traditions of Kerala. These educational spaces emphasised learning by
          doing, which is what we primarily love doing. We love to code, make, and
          play. In general, We do not like sitting in classrooms listening to
          lectures. If we have an idea, we start working on it, and people join in
          if they like it and are interested.
